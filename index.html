    <h1>History</h1>

    <p>In The 21st Centruy, the ChunkGlow Team decided to make a division after they made ChunkGlow Media International
        Network. They have chances to team up with YouTube and Spotify to make the company and the default radio station
        is 100.90 FM and 875 AM. Their website is "podcast.chunkglow.org" (not yet set) </p>


    <p>In making their podcast, they use a special programming language called "D#" and that type of language modifies
        and configures audio, video and image quality.</p>
